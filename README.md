# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Type Classification ‚Äì Deep Learning Project

This project explores the use of deep learning to classify cloud types‚Äî**Cumulus, Stratus, Cirrus, and Nimbus**‚Äîfrom images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning.  
It was completed as part of the *MSDS 610 ‚Äì Deep Learning* course at Bryant University.

## üß† Overview

Cloud type classification is a key task in atmospheric science, as it can support climate analysis, forecasting, and environmental monitoring.  
In this project, I developed and compared two deep learning models:
- A **custom CNN** built from scratch.
- A **transfer learning** approach using a pretrained **ResNet18** model from PyTorch.

Both models were trained and evaluated on a labeled cloud dataset containing four major cloud categories.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

**Framework:** PyTorch  
**Data Preprocessing:**
- Resizing, normalization (ImageNet mean/std), and augmentation (flips, rotations, color jitter)
- Stratified splits for train, validation, and test sets  

**Models:**
- Custom CNN with three convolutional layers and max pooling  
- ResNet18 (ImageNet weights) with fine-tuned fully connected layer  

**Training Setup:**
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss  
- Learning rate scheduling and early stopping applied  
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## üìä Results

| Model       | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Key Notes |
|--------------|--------------------:|---------------:|------------|
| Custom CNN   | ~78%                | ~80%           | Overfitting observed |
| ResNet18     | **~85%**            | **~85%**       | Best performance overall |

The **ResNet18** model demonstrated stronger generalization and faster convergence, effectively learning distinguishing features between the four cloud categories.  
However, some overlap remained between visually similar types such as Cumulus and Stratus.
